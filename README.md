# Horiseon Refactoring

## Description

Goal of project: Refactore website code

Website management reached out to help consildate code for easier reading, update title for search engine use, ensure proper HTML semantics are in place for viewing, cleaning up order of code, and added 'alt' code for all pictures for the website.

This refactoring was necessary to ensure the website had concise coding for future updates. With so many classifications originally set in the code making a small adjustment can take too much time. With CSS when you make a broader classification that applies to multiple sections it allows for faster alterations to be made.

Doing this refactoring of code for Horiseon website teach me a lot about how to read code. It is one thing to be able to learn the key terms, code, how they are used to make changes, and writing your own code. It is another to be able to look at set code and read it top to bottom understanding everything in the code structure.
